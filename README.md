# vrgl-imgproc
A simple attempt to create a simple image processing library in the [virgil](https://github.com/titzer/virgil) programming language.
It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use. The goal is to create a simple image processing library that can be used to perform basic image processing tasks such as image filtering, edge detection, etc. and to be used in a wasm environment.
